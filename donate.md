### Consider donating to the class!  

tl;dr: our class paypal link to donate for food
and equipment:

    - [paypalme/hackerfood](paypal.com/paypalme/hackerfood)

Even $30 helps defray costs, $700 will pay for a lab's worth of food,
$2k will pay for a section leader (the staff budget we are given is
woefully inadequate), and $25k can cover the quarter.

As always, all 140E class course materials are provided, free, in our github
repo, so helping this class helps others, too.

This quarter (2023) the class is 60 kids, and meets from tue/th 5:30pm
--- midnight.  We provide all equipment and since the class is so long
and not easy, we provide food.

As with all past years, I pay for both food and equipment money using my
Stanford salary.  As the class size grows, this expense is approaching
roughly half my take-home pay.  E.g., even with cheap domino's pizza
with all coupons the food budget is going to be around $1200 a week.
(So about 4.8k a month.)

You would think Stanford would pay for food and equipment, but they
do not.  It's an interesting game theory question as to why buildings
and administration costs win over teaching budgets, but I'm not smart
enough to solve for the optimal here.

In any case, the kids have to get fed, so please donate if you find
the material useful.

Note, the paypal method doesn't give a tax write-off, but on the other
hand there is zero administrative overhead, so the money goes right to
the kids.  (We're happy to send a photo of the receipt and food; or add a
"sponsors" list if that is useful) I can also provide btc or eth links.

For larger amounts from a company, we can also do gift donations through
Stanford, though after some of the recent scandals you might have seen in
the news this has become a several month affair.  (E.g., Meta donated last
year and it took about 3 months.)  For this route, just email directly
(engler@stanford.edu).
