In this lab, you implement a FAT32 file system. FAT32 is a disk format or filing system used to 
organize the files stored on a disk drive. The disk drive is marked up into addressable chunks 
called sectors and a “File Allocation Table” or FAT is created at the start of the drive so 
that each piece of information in the file can be found by the host computer. The “32” part 
of the name refers to the amount of bits that the filing system uses to store these addresses 
and was added mainly to distinguish it from its predecessor, which was called FAT16. The FAT32 
format was devised by Microsoft.
