# cs140e-23win

All material for CS140E, winter 2023.

## What is CS 140E?

CS 140E is an introductory operating systems course. It roughly covers the same
high-level material as [CS 212][cs212] (formerly CS 140), but with a focus on
embedded systems, interacting directly with hardware, and verification. Both
courses cover concepts such as virtual memory, filesystems, networking, and
scheduling, but take different approaches to doing so. By the end of 140E, you
will have (hopefully) built your own simple, clean operating system for the
widely-used, ARM-based [Raspberry Pi][raspberrypi].
